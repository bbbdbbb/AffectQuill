# Existing problems
- The cost of vision-and-language pre-training
- the gap between a frozen image encoder and a frozen LLM

# Innovation points
They propose a Querying Transformer (Q-Former) pre-trained with a new two-stage pre-training strategy.

# Useful points
- Q-Former

# keywords
- the modality gap

# Writing materials
We also demonstrate the modelâ€™s **emerging capabilities of zero-shot** image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.  

To reduce computation cost and **counteract** the issue of **catastrophic forgetting**, the unimodal pre-trained models remain frozen during the pre-training.  

The queries **interact with** each other through self-attention layers, and **interact with** frozen image features through cross-attention layers (inserted every other transformer block).   

The projected query embeddings are then **prepended to the input text embeddings**. They function as **soft visual prompts** that condition the LLM on visual representation extracted by the Q-Former.
